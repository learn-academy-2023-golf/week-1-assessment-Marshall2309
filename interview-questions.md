# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that offers direct version control of code. Github is a platform (built with Ruby on Rails) that is run with Git software.

Researched answer: Git is the version control system itself. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting services for Git repositories. 


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index of an array starts its count at 0, while the value of an array starts the count at 1.The index of an item is the same as labeling its position or location.

Researched answer: The index of an element in an array is its position within the array, and they are typically represented by non-negative integers.
The first element has an index of 0. This means that the index of the first element is 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. The value of an element in an array is the actual piece(s)data that the element holds. This can be any valid data type such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays can consist of multiple data types within the square brackets. Strings are contained in quotes.

Researched answer: Both arrays and strings are sequential data structures, meaning they store elements or characters in a linear order, and you can access them in a specific sequence. They also allow you to access individual elements or characters using indices. They are different in that arrays can hold elements of different data types within the same array, but strings typically store characters. 

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration.

2. Jest: a JavaScript testing framework

3. Objects:a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.
